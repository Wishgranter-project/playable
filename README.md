# Playable interface

This is an attempt to create an universal API to play multimedia,  
so applications may code for a single interface and use multiple vendors.

## Implementations

Here is a list of implementations I've wrote:

- [A wrapper for YouTube's embbed api](https://github.com/adinan-cenci/playable-youtube-wrapper)
- [A wrapper for the HTML native audio and video tags](https://github.com/adinan-cenci/playable-html-wrapper)
